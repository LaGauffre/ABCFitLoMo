# ABCFitLoMo
Online accompaniement (mainly python code) of the paper entitled "Approximate Bayesian Computations to fit and compare insurance loss models"

All the plots and picture of our paper are in the Figures folder

The Code folder contains the python package in the abcre folder and the python notebooks are named after each section of the paper and allows to reproduce the various plots. 

You must install python via anaconda, and instal some usual library like numpy, scipy and pandas.

You need to install the pymc3 library directly from github, beware since the SMC routines are still under active development the computation of model probabilities via pymc3 can be outdated.
