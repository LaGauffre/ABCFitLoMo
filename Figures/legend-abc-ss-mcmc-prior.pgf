%% Make sure the required packages are loaded in your preamble
%%   \usepackage{pgf}

%% Figures using additional raster images can only be included by \input if
%% they are in the same directory as the main LaTeX file. For loading figures
%% from other directories you can use the `import` package
%%   \usepackage{import}

%% and then include the figures with
%%   \import{<path to file>}{<filename>.pgf}
